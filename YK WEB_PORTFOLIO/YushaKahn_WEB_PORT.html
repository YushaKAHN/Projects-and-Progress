                <p>
                   <b>  A great interpretation of the symbolism of an orangutan. In addition to representing independence and self-reliance, the orangutan's long arms can indeed be seen as a symbol of reaching out to others and offering a helping hand. 
                        Orangutans have been observed engaging in cooperative behaviours, such as sharing food and grooming each other. They are also known for their gentle and empathetic nature, and have been observed comforting others who are distressed. As such, if you feel drawn to the orangutan as your spirit animal, it may be because you value compassion, kindness, and cooperation with others.
